<h1> About NodeJS </h1>
<hr>

<p> Before that, we shoud know a little background of JS, since it is highly responsible in making of NodeJS </p>

<ul> JS
  <li> Dec-4, 1995 JS got launched </li>
  <li> Used for websites or web designing </li>
  <li> A programming language which runs on machine (browser) </li>
</ul>


<code> JS runs on browser with the help of JSE<i> (Javascript Engine) </i> </code>
<br>
<code> JSE is nothing but a compiler which translated the JS code into machine code which browers understands easily </code>
# Those browser not having JSE, will not be able to run the JS code 

<ul> Which JSE is best ?
  <li> First JSE was Spider Monkey, which was Developed at Netscape. </li>
  <li> Then Internet Explorer created their own JSE called <i> CHAKRA </i> </li>
  <li> Google Chrome smartly analysed CHAKRA and came up with the fastest JSE called V8 </li>
</ul>


<ul> Now the question arises, how NODEJS came into picture ? 
  <li> Earlier, in backend there were PHP, Java, ASP  </li>
  <li> And in front-end: HTML, CSS and JS</li>
  <li> And we needed to know both the domains for the execution </li>
  <li> JS was getting used wisely in browser, desktop, phone and on web-server. </li>
  <br>
  
  <code> Now to run the JS on the machine, there was a requirement of Runtime-Environment </code> 

</ul>

# and that's where NodeJS gets created ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ

<hr>

<ul> Node JS
  <li> At first, it is a runt-time environment </li>
  <li> Simple JS code runs here</li>
  <li> It can create web-application</li>
  <li> Used in creating Web-Services</li>
  
</ul>
